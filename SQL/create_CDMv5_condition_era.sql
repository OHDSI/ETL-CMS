---Adapted to PostgreSQL condition_era from Pure SQL drug_era written by Chris_Knoll: https://gist.github.com/chrisknoll/c820cc12d833db2e3d1e
---Upgraded to v5 OMOP
---INTERVAL set to 30 days

---Chris Knoll's comments are after two dashes
---Taylor Delehanty's comments are after three dashes
---proper schema name needs to replace "synpuf5" in the code
---operates with a system that auto-generates condition_era_id
---can filter out unmapped condition_concept_id's /*see comment in code*/
